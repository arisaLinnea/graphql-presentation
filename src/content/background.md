# Background and intro

GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) that prioritizes giving clients exactly the data they request and no more. 
         
- One specification to get and set resources over HTTP
- One endpoint to rule them all /graphql

GraphQL was developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly (open-sourced) released in 2015.

GraphQL servers are available for multiple languages, including Haskell, JavaScript, Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, C++, C#, Scala, Go, Rust, Elixir, Erlang, PHP, R, and Clojure
